## NOTICE: iOS 10 and Azure Authentication

**If you're using plugin version < 0.8.x on iOS platform, we strongly recommend you to update your application to use newest version of the plugin in order to support authentication on iOS 10, otherwise your users will not be able to sign-in once iOS 10 is released.**

Once youâ€™ve updated plugin to the latest version your application will continue to work, there is no further code changes required for your application to continue working.

### To update your application using Cordova CLI

- navigate to your app's directory
- run the following commands:

    ```
    cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-ms-adal --save
    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ms-adal@0.8.x --save
    ```

## How To Use The Library

This plugin uses native SDKs for ADAL for each supported platform and provides single API across all platforms. Here is a quick usage sample:

```javascript

// Shows user authentication dialog if required
function authenticate(authCompletedCallback, errorCallback) {
  var authContext = new Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext(authority);
  authContext.tokenCache.readItems().then(function (items) {
    if (items.length > 0) {
        authority = items[0].authority;
        authContext = new Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext(authority);
    }
    // Attempt to authorize user silently
    authContext.acquireTokenSilentAsync(resourceUri, clientId)
    .then(authCompletedCallback, function () {
        // We require user credentials so triggers authentication dialog
        authContext.acquireTokenAsync(resourceUri, clientId, redirectUri)
        .then(authCompletedCallback, errorCallback);
    });
  });
};

authenticate(function(authResponse) {
  console.log("Token acquired: " + authResponse.accessToken);
  console.log("Token will expire on: " + authResponse.expiresOn);
}, function(err) {
  console.log("Failed to authenticate: " + err);
});
```

For more API documentation and examples see [Azure AD Cordova Getting Started](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-devquickstarts-cordova/) and JSDoc for exposed functionality stored in [www](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-cordova/tree/master/www) subfolder.

## Supported platforms

  * Android (OS 4.0.3 and higher)
  * iOS
  * Windows (Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows Phone 8.1)

## Creating new AuthenticationContext

The `Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext` class retrieves authentication tokens from Azure Active Directory and ADFS services.
Use `AuthenticationContext` constructor to synchronously create a new `AuthenticationContext` object.

#### Parameters
- __authority__: Authority url to send code and token requests. _(String)_ [Required]
- __validateAuthority__: Validate authority before sending token request. _(Boolean)_ (Default: `true`) [Optional]

#### Example
    var authContext = new Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext("https://login.windows.net/common");

## AuthenticationContext methods and properties
- acquireTokenAsync
- acquireTokenSilentAsync
- tokenCache

### acquireTokenAsync
The `AuthenticationContext.acquireTokenAsync` method asynchronously acquires token using interactive flow.
It **always shows UI** and skips token from cache.

- __resourceUrl__: Resource identifier. _(String)_ [Required]
- __clientId__: Client (application) identifier. _(String)_ [Required]
- __redirectUrl__: Redirect url for this application. _(String)_ [Required]
- __userId__: User identifier. _(String)_ [Optional]
- __extraQueryParameters__: Extra query parameters. Parameters should be escaped before passing to this method (e.g. using 'encodeURI()') _(String)_ [Optional]

__Note__: Those with experience in using native ADAL libraries should pay attention as the plugin uses `PromptBehaviour.Always`
when calling `AcquireToken` method and native libraries use `PromptBehaviour.Auto` by default. As a result
the plugin does not check the cache for existing access or refresh token. This is special design decision
so that `AcquireToken` is always showing a UX and `AcquireTokenSilent` never does so.

#### Example
```
var authContext = new Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext("https://login.windows.net/common");
authContext.acquireTokenAsync("https://graph.windows.net", "a5d92493-ae5a-4a9f-bcbf-9f1d354067d3", "http://MyDirectorySearcherApp")
  .then(function(authResponse) {
    console.log("Token acquired: " + authResponse.accessToken);
    console.log("Token will expire on: " + authResponse.expiresOn);
  }, function(err) {
    console.log("Failed to authenticate: " + err);
  });
```

### acquireTokenSilentAsync
The `AuthenticationContext.acquireTokenSilentAsync` method acquires token WITHOUT using interactive flow.
It checks the cache to return existing result if not expired. It tries to use refresh token if available.
If it fails to get token withoutd isplaying UI it will fail. This method guarantees that no UI will be shown to user.

- __resourceUrl__: Resource identifier. _(String)_ [Required]
- __clientId__: Client (application) identifier. _(String)_ [Required]
- __userId__: User identifier. _(String)_ [Optional]

#### Example
```
var authContext = new Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext("https://login.windows.net/common");
authContext.acquireTokenSilentAsync("https://graph.windows.net", "a5d92493-ae5a-4a9f-bcbf-9f1d354067d3")
  .then(function(authResponse) {
    console.log("Token acquired: " + authResponse.accessToken);
    console.log("Token will expire on: " + authResponse.expiresOn);
  }, function(err) {
    console.log("Failed to authenticate: " + err);
  });
```

### tokenCache
The `AuthenticationContext.tokenCache` property returns `TokenCache` class instance which stores access and refresh tokens.
This class could be used to retrieve cached items (`readItems` method), remove specific (`deleteItem` method) or all items (`clear` method).

#### Example
```
var authContext = new Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext("https://login.windows.net/common");
authContext.tokenCache.readItems().then(function (items) {
  console.log("Num cached items: " + items.length);
});
```

## Handling Errors

In case of method execution failure corresponding promise is rejected with a standard `JavaScript Error` instance.
The following error properties are available for you in this case:

* err.message - Human-readable description of the error.
* err.code - Error-code returned by native SDK; you can use this information to detect most common error reasons and provide extra
logic based on this information. **Important:** code is platform specific, see below for more details:
 * iOS: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc/blob/dev/ADAL/src/public/ADErrorCodes.h
 * Android: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android/blob/master/src/src/com/microsoft/aad/adal/ADALError.java
 * Windows: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/blob/master/src/ADAL.PCL/Constants.cs
* err.details - Raw error information returned by Apache Cordova bridge and native implementation (if available).

## Logging
You can configure the plugin to collect log messages from native libraries to help diagnose issues. To configure logging make the following call to set a callback that will be invoked every time when new log message is generated.
```javascript
Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationSettings.setLogger(function logger(logItem) {
  ...
});
```
`setLogger` method takes user's logger function, which will be triggered each time with `LogItem` instance when internal logs are received.
`LogItem` instance includes the following properties:
* message - A short log message describing the event that occurred
* additionalMessage - A longer message that contains other details relevant to event (android, iOS)
* level - The level (number) of the log message. **Important:** level is platform specific, see below for more details:
  * iOS: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc/blob/c891135340077046ddd1065bcaaad8dc8d29ea60/ADAL/src/public/ADLogger.h
  * Android: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android/blob/14794061e6791ea51a162195a8b17735b6a81ec5/adal/src/main/java/com/microsoft/aad/adal/Logger.java
  * Windows: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/blob/924ad544439e9b136ccc3cfc5ed9c07a984f3fb9/src/ADAL.PCL/IAdalLogCallback.cs
* tag - tag for the log message (android)
* errorCode - An integer error code if the log message is an error (android, iOS)

To set the logging level in your application call
```javascript
Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationSettings.setLogLevel(0)
.then(function() {
  ...
```

## Known issues and workarounds

## How to sign out

Similar to native labraries the plugin does not provide special method to sign out as it depends on server/application logic.
The recomendation here is

1. Step1: clear cache

    var authContext = new Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationContext("https://login.windows.net/common");
    authContext.tokenCache.clear();
1. Step2: make `XmlHttpRequest` (or open InAppBrowser instance) pointing to the sign out url.
In most cases the url should look like the following: `https://login.windows.net/{tenantid or "common"}/oauth2/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri={URL}`

## 'Class not registered' error on Windows

If you are using Visual Studio 2013 and see 'WinRTError: Class not registered' runtime error on Windows make sure Visual Studio [Update 5](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2013-update5-vs) is installed.

## Multiple login windows issue

Multiple login dialog windows will be shown if `acquireTokenAsync` is called multiple times and the token could not be acquired silently (at the first run for example). Use a [promise queueing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise-queue)/semaphore logic in the app code to avoid this issue.

## Setting up an Application in Azure AD

You can find detailed instructions how to set up a new application in Azure AD [here](https://github.com/AzureADSamples/NativeClient-MultiTarget-DotNet#step-4--register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant).

## Tests

This plugin contains test suite, based on [Cordova test-framework plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-test-framework). The test suite is placed under `tests` folder at the root or repo and represents a separate plugin.

To run the tests you need to create a new application as described in [Installation Instructions section](#installation-instructions) and then do the following steps:

* Add test suite to application

    ```
    cordova plugin add ../azure-activedirectory-library-for-cordova/tests
    ```

* Update application's config.xml file: change `<content src="index.html" />` to `<content src="cdvtests/index.html" />`
* Change AD-specific settings for test application at the beginning of `plugins\cordova-plugin-ms-adal\www\tests.js` file. Update `AUTHORITY_URL`, `RESOURCE_URL`, `REDIRECT_URL`, `APP_ID` to values, provided by your Azure AD. For instructions how to setup an Azure AD application see [Setting up an Application in Azure AD section](#setting-up-an-application-in-azure-ad).
* Build and run application.

## Windows Quirks ##
Plugin is based on native ADAL v2 as ADAL v3 [does not support Winmd anymore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37467211/adal-3-windown-8-1-app-nuget-update-failing#comment62469160_37468708).

### Using ADFS/SSO
To use ADFS/SSO on Windows platform (Windows Phone 8.1 is not supported for now) add the following preference into `config.xml`:
`<preference name="adal-use-corporate-network" value="true" />`

`adal-use-corporate-network` is `false` by default.

It will add all needed application capabilities and toggle authContext to support ADFS. You can change its value to `false` and back later, or remove it from `config.xml` - call `cordova prepare` after it to apply the changes.

__Note__: You should not normally use `adal-use-corporate-network` as it adds capabilities, which prevents an app from being published in the Windows Store.

## Android Quirks ##
### Broker support
The following method should be used to enable broker component support (delivered with Intune's Company portal app). Read [ADAL for Android](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android) to understand broker concept in more details.

```javascript
Microsoft.ADAL.AuthenticationSettings.setUseBroker(true)
.then(function() {
  ...
```

__Note__: Developer needs to register special redirectUri for broker usage. RedirectUri is in the format of `msauth://packagename/Base64UrlencodedSignature`

## iOS Quirks ##
### Broker support
Plugin automatically detects whether to enable brokered authentication based on redirectUri format (if starts with `x-msauth-`).
Developer needs to register special redirectUri for broker usage following format below:
```
x-msauth-<your-bundle-id>://<your.bundle.id>
ex: x-msauth-com-microsoft-mytestiosapp://com.microsoft.mytestiosapp
```
Read [ADAL for iOS](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc#brokered-authentication) to understand broker concept in more details.
